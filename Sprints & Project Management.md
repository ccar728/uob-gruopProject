# Iterative models

For the management of this collaborative project, we chose the Stagewise-Model approach to group work, which has its own characteristics and is well suited to applications such as ours where minor changes to functional requirements may be made in the first and middle stages. The technical feature of the iterative model is that it does not require the development of a complete software system in one go, but sees software development as a process of progressively acquiring points of improvement, obtaining requirements and refining the software product. In addition to this, we assign each person a job description, which has already been mentioned in the section above. If there are issues that we don't understand or need to discuss, we put them in our discussion groups so that everyone can make suggestions on how to rationalise them and we set up a workable schedule to communicate the progress of the project (via Zoom or Wechat) and arrange the next steps to ensure that the project This will ensure that the project is well organised, that it is completed ahead of schedule and that there is enough time for TAs or professors to comment on changes. In an iterative development approach, the development work is organised into a series of short, fixed length (e.g. 4 weeks) projects called a series of iterations. Each iteration includes requirements analysis, design, implementation and testing. With this approach, development work can be initiated before requirements are fully defined and a portion of the system's functionality or business logic can be developed in a single iteration. The requirements are then refined through customer feedback and a new iteration is started. 

The difference between an iteration and a version can be understood as follows: an iteration generally refers to the production process of a particular version, including from the analysis of requirements to the completion of testing; a version generally refers to the result of a phase of software development, a deliverable product. A specific illustration of the iteration model is as follows.

Benefits: 

1. Reduces the risk of spending on an increment. If a developer repeats an iteration, all that is lost is the cost of that one iteration that was developed incorrectly. 
2. Reduces the risk that the product will not reach the market on schedule. By identifying risks early in development, they can be addressed earlier rather than being rushed later in development. 
3. The overall development process is accelerated. Developers work more efficiently because they know exactly where to focus their problems. 
4. Because user requirements are not fully defined at the outset, they are usually refined in subsequent phases. Therefore, the iterative process model makes it easier to adapt to changes in requirements. Reusability is therefore higher.

# Sprints & Meetings

For this team project, we are team number 17 and we drew up a schedule with 6 meetings at several important points (between April 3rd and May 5th, which is the sprint period for our team project, each team member was asked to participate as much as possible, especially if the discussion was relevant to the member's position and should be mandatory), and listed the key issues that the team members should discuss in each meeting. These issues were crucial to our team project, as some of our team were in China and some in the UK, and the entire schedule ended up being held in Zoom for convenience. This is followed by a description of what were the main issues of concern and discussion during our last 6 sprints. The schedule is as follows.

During the development process we were divided into 3 phases: Preparatory Phase, Spring Cycle, Final Stage, each with a small T-phase, the Preparatory Phase consisted of two T1 and T2 events, the Sprint Cycle phase consisted of During the Sprint Cycle phase, our team was able to move very quickly through the project, and we were able to quickly locate the problems that each of us had after the Zoom meeting, make changes and optimise them, and start working on the next tasks. At the final stage, there was only one T8 event, at which point our project was completed and the overall minor changes were made during the T8 event. The following is a collation of all the T events.

* T1: completion of the project proposal
* T2: prototype decision, data collection
* T3: After the first Zoom meeting, the back-end starts writing functional code and UI/UX design begins
* T4: after the second Zoom meeting, front-end code writing begins and interaction features are defined
* T5: After the third meeting of Zoom, writing of the back-end code continues and is completed by 4.30. During this time, a time is chosen to discuss the next optimisations for the project with Allison (TA), the assistant coach.
* T6: After Zoom's fourth meeting, finish the front-end code and UI/UX design presentation, adding some game elements as discussed with the TA during event T5.
* T7: After the fifth meeting of Zoom, the overall project was almost completed and all the features were tested. It was also made available to some users for use and to gather their opinions.
* T8: After the sixth meeting of Zoom, the whole project was summarised, the readme file was sorted and supplemented, all the previous text files were uploaded, and the whole readme file was optimised and ready for submission to the team.

The following is a review of our Zoom meetings at six key points in time, and [here](https://shimo.im/sheets/C9Qk8y6hDyPVX3xw/MODOC/ 「Meeting Minutes」，可复制链接后用石墨文档 App 或小程序打开) are the minutes of our meetings. Below we will elaborate on the discussions we had during the Zoom meetings in response to some of the questions.

In this Zoom meeting on 3 April, we focused on the presentation and discussion of Familiarisation with what the team project entails. Getting to know the different positions needed for the project as a whole and assigning the work that each person should handle. Rationalising the project according to the requirements of the task and defining the direction we should design. For example, we ended up with the idea of designing a bookkeeping webpage called Fortune Cat and adding fun game elements to it at the beginning of May.

At the Zoom meeting on 9 April, we will schedule 3 things. Work out the details of everyone's work in detail
Sorting out the issues left over from last week's discussion start the functional design of the application.

On 14 April, the following 4 things will be discussed to identify the key issues that should be sprinted in the next few days. Finish the first presentation of the front-end part first. Get feedback from TA Allison on the project and get some key issues that need to be optimised and improved. Understand what to query next to make the project a more interesting element. Start writing the project report.

On 18 April, a fourth group meeting took place, focusing on the following issues. Deciding on the back-end implementation calculations, followed by an offline discussion with 5 people to start writing the back-end part of the code. Discussed and refined the UI/UX design. 

On the 30th of April, the fifth meeting of our team was held to report on the progress of the last issue and to summarise the unfinished work, with the main reports as follows. UI/UX progress completed.
Ready to apply UI/UX design to the project. The back-end code was written by 2-3 people and the application was successfully run in conjunction with the front-end code. Discussion of subsequent application optimisation issues and modifications.

On the 5th of May, all team members had a final Zoom meeting to consolidate what each member was responsible for, mainly mentioning the following. The reporting section is almost complete. Optimisation of this bookkeeping software. Summarising the project report as a whole.

So far, we have had 6 Zoom meetings and have team groups under the meetings. The team groups are used for multiple exchanges on complex problems, where often some complex problems cannot be solved immediately and require time to look up information and learn new things. Overall, the whole team of 5 people were very responsible for their position in the team and were able to give feasible solutions to the problem points they needed to deal with in a timely manner. In the end, all members worked together to complete such a relatively satisfactory project.



# Using Git

Our team set up a github account, and when creating the repository, we realised that there would be 3 people uploading at any time, so it was necessary to set it up on the main branch, and in addition to that, we had to give each programmer permissions separately, which is the most convenient for programmers in terms of convenience. There are three main repositories, including a front-end repository, a back-end repository and a Project-Account repository (which contains flowcharts, mind maps and README files).

The overall GIT continuous integration and deployment mainly involves basic git commands, including git clone, git add, git commit, git push, etc. The deployment of the project code is done through the basic git commands.
