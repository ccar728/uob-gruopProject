# How to design a bookkeeping app

In "Gamification in Action", Tae-Yu Kim summarises eight core drivers of user behaviour, which in part nicely illustrate the various designs in bookkeeping apps.

**Core Driver 1: Epic Meaning and Mission. This driver means: the internal drive of people who need meaning to reinforce their behaviour. Users are motivated to become driven when they believe they are not just accomplishing something, but working towards a great mission. **

**Core Driver 2: Progress and Achievement. This drive is the desire to grow and be recognised; a natural intrinsic drive to make progress, improve skills, complete tasks and overcome obstacles. **



### Available App: Bookkeeping City

In [Bookkeeping City], the user takes on the role of a mayor, earning a building within the app for each bookkeeping action, encouraging the user to create a prosperous and great city through persistent bookkeeping actions. The medal system is meant to be a way to encourage persistence, but in this app, it seems to be too much force is used.

### Available App: Handy Notes

In [Handy Notes], if a user has been keeping accounts for many days, the app will display the number of days the user has been keeping accounts on the opening screen. This is designed to give users a sense of achievement if they have been keeping track of their accounts on a daily basis, but when users have been keeping track of their accounts for many days in a row, and then one day they stop for some reason, the disappearance of the continuous account reminder on the opening screen can cause a great sense of loss.

### Available App: Qoin

In [Qoin], the notes for each entry are limited to category, time, and custom notes, with a maximum of 5 categories. This can be painful at first, but assuming the user implements this categorisation process, it will greatly speed up the selection process and provide a clearer picture of where financial expenses are going. We have designed the app to ease this painful process by recommending default bookkeeping categories and then also supporting user-defined deletion, addition and modification of category tags.

### Available App: Digging for Wealth

【Digging for Wealth】is an app for professional users and even for some finance staff to meet their daily work needs, it has special financial management functions as well as money alerts. Users can invest their money on this app and make purchases and redemptions of funds and stocks. But this app is too feature-rich to be of any use to beginners.

### Existing App: timi Bookkeeping

Timi Bookkeeping] is the simplest of the several existing bookkeeping apps mentioned above, but the core functionality is generally complete, but some useless new features have been added (e.g. photo bookkeeping, but this feature has been removed in the latest version) and there are opening screen ads.
